Here are some of the key areas and recent trends:\n\n**1. Enhanced Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Multi-omics Integration:** AI is getting much better at integrating diverse biological data sources – genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and even patient health records – to identify novel drug targets and understand disease pathways more holistically. This can reveal targets that wouldn't be apparent from a single data type.\n*   **Causal Inference:** Moving beyond correlation, AI models are being developed to infer causal relationships between genes, proteins, and diseases, leading to more confident identification of targets that are likely to be therapeutically relevant.\n*   **\"Undruggable\" Targets:** AI is showing promise in identifying ways to target proteins that were previously considered \"undruggable\" due to their structure or function, opening up new avenues for treating challenging diseases.\n\n**2. Accelerated Molecule Design and Optimization:**\n\n*   **Generative AI for Novel Molecules:** This is a huge area of growth. Generative models (like GANs, VAEs, and more recently, transformer-based models) are being used to design entirely new molecular structures with desired properties (e.g., binding affinity, ADMET – Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity).\n*   **In Silico Screening Advancements:** AI is making virtual screening of vast chemical libraries more efficient and accurate. It can predict how well millions of compounds might bind to a target, prioritizing the most promising ones for experimental testing.\n*   **De Novo Design for Specific Properties:** AI can now be trained to design molecules \"from scratch\" that not only bind to a target but also possess favorable pharmacokinetic (how the body handles the drug) and safety profiles.\n\n**3. Predictive Modeling for Efficacy and Toxicity:**\n\n*   **More Accurate ADMET Prediction:** AI models are continuously improving their ability to predict the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity of drug candidates early in the development process. This helps to de-risk the pipeline and reduce costly late-stage failures.\n*   **Predicting Clinical Trial Success:** While still in its early stages, there's a growing effort to use AI to predict the likelihood of a drug candidate succeeding in clinical trials based on preclinical data and similarities to past trials.\n*   **Personalized Efficacy Prediction:** As mentioned before, AI is key to predicting how a specific drug might work in different patient populations or even individual patients based on their unique biological profiles.\n\n**4. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **AI-powered Repurposing Platforms:** AI can rapidly scan databases of existing drugs and match them to new disease indications based on molecular pathways, gene expression profiles, and other data. This is a faster and often cheaper route to new therapies.\n\n**5. Automation and High-Throughput Experimentation:**\n\n*   **AI-Guided Experimentation:** AI is being integrated with robotic lab systems to autonomously design, execute, and analyze experiments. This creates a virtuous cycle where AI learns from experimental results to design even better experiments.\n\n**Examples of Companies and Initiatives:**\n\nMany companies are at the forefront of this revolution, including:\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Known for its AI-driven approach to discovering novel targets and designing molecules, including drugs for fibrosis and aging.\n*   **Exscientia:** Uses AI to design novel molecules and optimize drug candidates, with several programs in clinical trials.\n*   **Atomwise:** Utilizes deep learning for structure-based drug discovery, screening billions of compounds.\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Combines AI, automation, and experimental biology to map human cellular biology and discover new treatments.\n*   **BenevolentAI:** Applies AI to analyze scientific literature and biomedical data to identify new therapeutic targets and drug candidates.\n\n**Key Takeaways for New Developments:**\n\n*   **Shift towards \"De Novo\" Design:** AI is moving beyond just screening existing libraries to *creating* entirely new drug-like molecules.\n*   **Greater Data Integration:** The power of AI in drug discovery is amplified by its ability to analyze and integrate increasingly complex and diverse biological datasets.\n*   **Focus on Real-World Data:** Incorporating real-world evidence (RWE) from electronic health records and other sources is becoming crucial for validating AI predictions.\n*   **Faster Timelines:** The overarching goal is to drastically reduce the time and cost of bringing new drugs to patients.\n\nThe field is moving incredibly fast, so staying updated often involves following industry news, scientific publications, and company announcements.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to the second development I mentioned: **Accelerated Molecule Design and Optimization**. This is a really exciting and dynamic area of AI in drug discovery.\n\nLet's break down what it entails and why it's so impactful:\n\n**The Core Idea:**\n\nTraditional drug discovery often involves synthesizing and testing thousands, if not millions, of chemical compounds to find one that effectively interacts with a specific biological target (like a protein involved in a disease). This is a laborious, expensive, and time-consuming process.\n\nAI is revolutionizing this by:\n\n1.  **Designing entirely new molecules:** Instead of just searching through existing libraries, AI can *create* novel chemical structures with desired properties.\n2.  **Optimizing existing molecules:** AI can take a promising but imperfect molecule and suggest modifications to improve its potency, selectivity, or reduce its toxicity.\n3.  **Predicting molecular behavior:** AI models can accurately predict how a molecule will behave in biological systems *before* it's synthesized and tested in the lab.\n\n**Key AI Techniques Involved:**\n\n*   **Generative Models:** These are AI algorithms that learn the patterns and underlying rules of chemical structures and can then generate new, plausible molecules. Think of it like an artist learning to paint in a certain style and then creating original works in that style.\n    *   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Two neural networks (a generator and a discriminator) work against each other. The generator creates molecules, and the discriminator tries to tell them apart from real molecules. This competition drives the generator to produce increasingly realistic and novel structures.\n    *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed representation (a \"latent space\") of known molecules. By sampling from this latent space, they can generate new molecules.\n    *   **Transformer Networks (like those used in LLMs):** These are increasingly being adapted for molecule generation. They can learn sequential relationships in chemical structures (represented as strings of characters, like SMILES notation) and generate novel sequences.\n*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** RL algorithms can be used to guide the generation process. The AI is \"rewarded\" for creating molecules that meet specific criteria (e.g., high binding affinity to a target, good solubility).\n*   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** Molecules are naturally represented as graphs (atoms as nodes, bonds as edges). GNNs are excellent at processing this type of data and can learn intricate relationships between molecular structure and properties.\n*   **Machine Learning for Property Prediction:** Standard supervised learning models are trained on large datasets of known molecules and their measured properties (e.g., solubility, toxicity, binding affinity). These models can then predict these properties for newly designed molecules.\n\n**How it Accelerates the Process:**\n\n*   **Reduced Experimental Burden:** By designing molecules that are more likely to be successful, AI significantly reduces the number of compounds that need to be synthesized and experimentally tested.\n*   **Faster Iteration Cycles:** AI allows for rapid exploration of chemical space. A few AI models can design and evaluate thousands of potential candidates in a fraction of the time it would take a human chemist.\n*   **Discovery of Novel Chemical Space:** AI isn't limited by human intuition or existing chemical knowledge. It can explore completely novel molecular architectures that might not have been considered otherwise, leading to potentially groundbreaking new drugs.\n*   **Optimization of Multiple Properties Simultaneously:** AI can be trained to balance competing objectives. For example, it can design a molecule that is both highly potent against a target *and* has low toxicity, which is often a difficult trade-off for human chemists.\n\n**Impact and Examples:**\n\n*   **Early Stage Drug Candidates:** Many AI-first drug discovery companies are now advancing their AI-designed molecules into preclinical and even clinical development.\n*   **Examples:** Companies like **Insilico Medicine**, **Exscientia**, and **Atomwise** are prominent in this area. Insilico Medicine, for example, recently announced an AI-designed drug candidate that moved from discovery to IND (Investigational New Drug) filing in a record short time.\n\n**In essence, AI is transforming molecule design from a guided search and synthesis process into an intelligent, data-driven creative endeavor, dramatically speeding up the journey from concept to potential medicine.**\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the companies driving innovation in **AI-driven molecule design and optimization**.

It also mentioned several companies leading in this field.\n\nFinally, the user asked for more information on the \"Accelerated Molecule Design and Optimization\" development. The AI agent elaborated on this by explaining how AI is revolutionizing the process from traditional laborious testing to designing novel molecules, optimizing existing ones, and predicting their behavior. It detailed the AI techniques involved (Generative Models like GANs and VAEs, RL, GNNs, ML for property prediction) and explained how these accelerate drug discovery by reducing experimental burden, enabling faster iteration, discovering novel chemical space, and optimizing multiple properties simultaneously. Examples of companies like Insilico Medicine and Exscientia were reiterated.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":38},{"cell_type":"code","source":"len(final_session.events)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-14T00:19:22.887097Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-14T00:19:22.887364Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-14T00:19:22.892277Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-14T00:19:22.887344Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-14T00:19:22.891460Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":16,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"10"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":16},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(final_session.events[0].actions.compaction)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-14T00:22:31.269159Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-14T00:22:31.269485Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-14T00:22:31.273755Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-14T00:22:31.269463Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-14T00:22:31.273033Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"None\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":27},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.4 What you've accomplished: Automatic Context Management\n\nYou just found the proof! The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
